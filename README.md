# Helium Reader Monorepo Reset

This repository was reset from the legacy web/electron stack to a Flutter-first implementation.

- App project: `helium_reader/`
- Preserved secrets: `credentials/`
- Credential copy helper: `copy_credentials.ps1`
- MySQL run helper: `run_with_mysql.ps1`

See `helium_reader/README.md` for setup, `--dart-define` keys, MySQL schema, and run commands.
